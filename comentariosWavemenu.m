% Loading Signals into the Continuous Wavelet 1-D Tool
% To load a signal you’ve constructed in your M
% ATLAB
%  workspace into the
% Continuous Wavelet 1-D tool, save the signal in a MAT-file that has the
% same name as the signal variable itself. 
% For instance, suppose you’ve designed a signal called
% warma and want to
% analyze it in the Continuous Wavelet 1-D tool.
% » save warma
% 
% The workspace variable warma must be a vector.
% » sizwarma = size(warma)  
% sizwarma =
%            1        1000
% To load this signal into the Continuous Wavelet 1-D tool, use the menu
% option File?Load Signal.
% A dialog box appears that lets you select the appropriate MAT-file to be loaded.
